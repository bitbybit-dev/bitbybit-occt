// This is patching a disconnect between types of OpenCascade.js and their actual implementation

// Check these discussions on opencascade.js github:
// https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js/issues/21
// https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js/issues/55

// You can also check this occt documentation page

// &First and &Last get values assigned in constructor itself instead of returning those normally as some single object. This is quite messed up and not "pure", but it's C++ and it can be done and OCCT team did that :)
// Curve (const TopoDS_Edge &E, Standard_Real &First, Standard_Real &Last)

// Opencascade.js on the other hand generates types automatically, but they did implement solution to pass ReferencedReturn kind objects to get the values out of these methods

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
